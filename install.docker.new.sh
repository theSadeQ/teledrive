  If you encounter the following error after deploying:
  failed to solve: error from sender: open /home/user/teledrive/docker/data: permission denied

  Please run the following commands:
  cd docker
  sudo chmod -R 777 data

  Then, you can go back to the root directory of the project with
  cd ../

  You can then start the script again, and the issue should be resolved. Note that the permissions will be reset, so you will need to perform this step every time you redeploy the docker.
